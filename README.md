# Solver-and-visualizer

This is my student project, the task of which is to learn how to design GUI apps.
Implemented an application - solver and visualizer of the optimization method (steepest descent method) for a two-dimensional function in this work.
To implement the graphical interface of the application was used PyQt5 toolkit.
